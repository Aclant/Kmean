# Kmean

As required for the exercice there is a Kmean Library that could be use via interface to do the k mean algorithme on a table of Points.
Also there is a windows form for the visualization of the result (series# for the cluster# and centroid # for the centroid of the cluster#)
There is a test File to do the basic testing on the Cluster fonction.
For the calculation I decidde that if the Datas are empty or the number of iteration is 0 or the number of Cluster is 0 to return empty tables for the results.

Currently the Library could be easily modify to add a new kind of IPoint to manage other type of Data Points.
